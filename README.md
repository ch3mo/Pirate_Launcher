## FAQ
- **Why is there a delay on first add?**  
The launcher scrapes art and description from online APIs. Once cached, it's instant and works offline.

- **No art or description for a game?**  
Try renaming the game to match the exact title on RAWG or Steam. If it persists, the game may not be indexed yet.

- **Game not launching?**  
Ensure the `.exe` path is correct. Some games may require additional dependencies or admin rights.

- **How to add Microsoft Store games?**  
Use "Pirated Games" option and navigate to `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` (may require admin access).

- **Can I add custom platforms?**  
Currently supports Pirated, Steam, Xbox. For others, use "Pirated Games" option.

- **Is this secure?**  
Yes, no data is shared. All scraping is local; no personal info stored.
